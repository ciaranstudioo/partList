export const missionText = `   As humanity grows exponentially in scale and complexity, we measure, manage, and think of more and more aspects of the world through units, metrics, systems and frameworks. Data-driven systems, through atomization, rely on deterministic logic to understand and instrumentalize information captured about us. Data capture increases, but this does not necessarily translate into greater holistic understanding; instead, the result is often heightened atomization and greater categorical fracturing. In this paradigm, we consider the relation between what can’t or shouldn’t be quantified—such as the natural world, including humanity—and the deterministic infrastructure we find ourselves within.
        
    One strategy is to emphasize the role of stories, of art, of nature, of community—to give the things and activities we value as much space as possible to counter the invasiveness of deterministic logic.  While this approach is essential, our aim with this project is to focus more precisely on the relationship between the non-measurable and the data-driven, on the perspective that allows us to see both paradigms at once. 
        
    (Who and what determines the terms of these relationships? How might this develop and evolve in the future? Can we imagine shared global systems that are qualitative and holistic rather than quantitative and fragmented? How exactly do we make room in our collective “big picture” (governance, resource management, economic tools, information technologies, etc.) for everything that can’t be mapped or measured? Can we befriend map dragons?)`;
